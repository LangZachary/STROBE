/*  Root function for processing buttons.
 *  button_wait is a variable that gets decremented every 20ms. It is set to 1 when
 *  the buttons have been checked but none pressed, and set to 25 when a button is
 *  pressed.  This is so there is a .5s delay between button presses. When it hits 0,
 *  the buttons are ready to be read / processed.
 *  If a button is pressed an action is taken and the buttons pressed is reset.
